```

3. **Configure API Keys:**

- Open the `key_secrets.py` file in the project directory.
- Add your API keys for Twitter, Genius, and ChatGPT to this file.

```python
# key_secrets.py

# Twitter API Keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'your_twitter_consumer_secret'
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_twitter_access_token'
